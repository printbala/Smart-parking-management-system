# Smart-parking-management-system
Hey there! Welcome to our Smart Parking Management System project on GitHub! Our goal here is to make parking easier using IoT and Arduino tech. We've got 6 IR sensors to track parking slots, an LCD display for real-time info, a servo motor as a gate, and LEDs to help drivers find spots.

ðŸš§ It's a work in progress! ðŸš§
Just a heads up, we're still working on it. Your interest means a lot, so check back for updates. And hey, if you have ideas or want to help out, we're all ears!

Here's what we've got so far:

- IR Sensors: Check parking slot availability.
- LCD Display: Shows available slots and gives welcome/thank you messages.
- Servo Motor: Acts as a gate.
- LEDs: Help drivers find open spots.
- Parking Slot Count: Displays available slots at entry.
For setting up, you'll need:

- Arduino Board
- 6 IR Sensors
- LCD Display with I2C Module
- Servo Motor
- LEDs
- Jumper Wires
Just upload the Arduino code provided and connect everything based on the circuit diagram.

Ready to go? Power it up and make sure everything's working right.

What's next? Here are some ideas:

- Mobile App: Check parking availability and reserve spots.
- Camera System: For security and monitoring.
- Payment System: Automated parking fee collection.
- Machine Learning: Predict parking space availability.
- IoT Cloud: Centralized monitoring and control.
